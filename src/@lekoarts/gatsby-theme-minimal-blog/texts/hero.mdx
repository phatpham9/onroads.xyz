<h2 style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Hi there, I'm Phat Pham 👋</h2>

A lifelong learner, tech enthusiast & open source lover from Vietnam.

I am good at building MVPs. Lately I've been focusing on Cloud Native, Microservices & Serverless to build reactive systems.

I am maintaining [BoringCode.dev](https://boringcode.dev) - a set of tools that makes developers life easier in my freetime.

I am studying M.S. Computer Science also. You can find my AI/ML experiments on Hugging Face [/phatpham9](https://huggingface.co/phatpham9).
